    <p>The fastest way to slow global warming</p>

    <p>Human-caused methane emissions are responsible for at least 25% of the warming
      we are experiencing.
      The oil and gas industry is a major source.</p>

    <p>EDF is leading the charge to reduce methane emissions worldwide.</p>

  <div class="Content-child Content-child3">
    <p>Across North America, climate-polluting methane and other dangerous pollutants are leaking from millions of
      inactive oil and gas wells whose owners are insolvent or unidentifiable. Early in 2020, EDF’s Dr. Shareen
      Yawanarajah, a petroleum geologist, met with Canadian officials and suggested a
      solution: Use federal funds to plug those wells, creating jobs and cutting dangerous pollution.</p>

  <div class="Content-child Content-child4">
    <p>Since Canada’s powerful oil and gas industry was lobbying at the very same time against methane protections, “I
      expected the worst,” Yawanarajah confesses. To her delight, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.7 billion
      plan to clean up wells and create thousands of jobs. EDF is now helping shape a similar stimulus program in the
      United States.</p>

    <p> Cutting methane emissions is the fastest and most effective way to slow the rate of global warming. EDF is at
      the forefront of this effort. Our groundbreaking work has exposed how pervasive oil and gas methane emissions are.
      A new satellite from our subsidiary MethaneSAT LLC will locate and quantify these emissions around the world with
      unrivaled precision — making them impossible for companies to ignore.</p>
    <p>In Europe, the European Commission’s new methane strategy aligns with many of EDF’s recommendations, and it
      includes a monitoring and verification system designed by EDF scientists. The commission is considering a methane
      standard for imported gas — the EU is the world’s largest market — which would cut emissions internationally.</p>
